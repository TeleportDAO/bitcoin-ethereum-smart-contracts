* If a natural fork comes up, the abandoned block's collateral stays in the relay

* see if we want to send the abandoned headers collaterals + protocol fees to a treasury?

* if a natural fork comes up, the relayer of the abandoned block can later come provide a proof and get its collateral back
(before the corresponding height gets finalized and pruned), dispute is not necessarily needed for providing proofs

TODO: set zero the previousBlock mapping when dispute is successful (so same root can be submitted again)
TODO: remove it from chain and elsewhere in above case
TODO: add a mapping unverifiedParentRoot: concat(height, idx, root) -> parent root
to check if the previously submitten root is verified yet or not 
TODO: test target changing arrays
TODO: getDisputeReward can be called multiple times (proposed sol: remove the root from chain in the end of the func)
TODO: stored data match -> input can be merkle root instead of height and idx
TODO: combine checkEpochendBlock and checkRetarget functions
TODO: _oldPeriodEndHeader can be right root and wrong time and target to prove a wrong new epoch header
TODO: in verify after dispute, don't send the dispute collateral if the header had not been disputed (add the payment to the if statement)
TODO: combine _verifyHeader and _verifyHeaderAfterDispute
TODO: comments (addblock especially wrong dev)
TODO: note that when pruning, you might delete a disputed block so the disputer could not get back his collateral
TODO: in _pruneHeight do not verify the header bcz it emits wrong event and if disputed before, the disputer loses his collateral
TODO: when verify after dispute, we do not prune chain (probably you can add prune chain to the verify header itself to check it each time)

DONE: add steps explaining comments to _checkHeaderProof()
DONE: require collaterals to be equal to the mins, (and remove numCollateral... variables) -> didn't cuz totalTNT()
