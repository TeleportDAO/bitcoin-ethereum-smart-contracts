* If a natural fork comes up, the abandoned block's collateral stays in the relay

* see if we want to send the abandoned headers collaterals + protocol fees to a treasury?

* if a natural fork comes up, the relayer of the abandoned block can later come provide a proof and get its collateral back
(before the corresponding height gets finalized and pruned), dispute is not necessarily needed for providing proofs
